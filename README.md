The json data can be aquired from the smcd.exe Xaya GSP or, you can link directly to the json data on the soccer manager elite website (for now and if not abused). These are updated every few minutes.

e.g.
https://soccermanagerelite.com/stats/transfers.json

Included in the code is some old static data / json files for reference and testing.
